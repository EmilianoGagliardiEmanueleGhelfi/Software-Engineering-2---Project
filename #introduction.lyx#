Description of the given problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this document is to support the developement of a software
 that manages a car sharing services.
 The software that will be developed has the aim to make the reservation
 of cars simple and qick.
 So the system should provide users with real time information about avaiability
 of cars, and their positions.
 Cars will be parked in some pre-defined parking area, where user can directly
 get them afther the reservation.
 The service will be provide only to user that have made the registration,
 giving some personal information and data needed to the payment.
 The price of the ride is computed with a fixed amount of minutes, displayed
 by the car, and finally charged.
 To avoid useless reservation, where a user doesn't pick up the car, the
 system should be able to detect that after a fixed time, retag the car
 avaiable, and charge with a fee the user.
 Cars must be loked in the safe areas, and unlokable only by users that
 has made a reservation on them.
