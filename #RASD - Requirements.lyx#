\begin_layout Subsection
Functional Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After having defined main features of our system we can identify some functional
 requirements grouped under each defined actor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GUEST, he can:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Sign up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Search for a car near his location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Search for a car near a selected location.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
USER, he can:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Log in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reserve car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use a reserved car (unlocking it).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
View his profile (also his discounts).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Modify his profile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
View his recent reservations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Search car near to his location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Search car near a selected location.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
OPERATOR, he can:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
View car's status (battery and location).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Receive notification when a car need to be charged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Set a car as available or under maintainance.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Non-functional Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
User Interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make PowerEnJoy available for many people as possible a Cross-Platfo
rm application has to be devloped, with a Framework like Xamarin.
 In this way could be developed a single application and then could be deployed
 for Windows Phone, Android and iOS.
 A Web Application has also to be developed in order to allow people to
 use our system in many way as possible.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The User Interface needs to be as user friendly as possible, a user that
 uses for the first time Power EnJoy should be able to learn in a few seconds
 how to make use of it.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Here are presented a few screen of the app to provide an example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system has to satisfy an high level of security regarding the communication
 protocol with the cars.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The communication with the cars needs to be encrypted in order to avoid
 unauthorized unlocks and use.
 Futhermore the system should have the way to stop cars when used in an
 unauthorized way.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Regarding the security of payment, the system does't care about it because
 it relies on external payment system.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Another critical security point is the managing of user's information: all
 user informations need to be encrypted before being sent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These documents will be released in order to well-organize the work in the
 way to obtain the best quality-cost ratio as possible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{RASD}$
\end_inset

: Requirements Analysis and Specification Document, to well-understand the
 given problem and to analyze system's boundaries and goal.
 RASD is also important to understan system's requirements and specifications
 in order to reach the goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\boldsymbol{DD}}:$
\end_inset

Design Document, to define the structure of the the system, his tiers, and
 the interaction between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{ITPD}$
\end_inset

: Integration Test Plan Document, to describe the planning to accomplish
 the integration test.
 This document is supposed to be written before the integration test really
 happens.
 Moreover this document needs to explain to the developer team what to test,
 in which sequence, which tools are needed for testing and wich need to
 be devloped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{PP}$
\end_inset

: Project Plan, aims at defining a planning for the project.
 It regard in particular the estimation of effort and cost, the scheduling
 for project's task and the allocation of resources to tasks.
